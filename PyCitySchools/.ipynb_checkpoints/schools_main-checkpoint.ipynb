    "65% of the nearly 40,000 students in the district passed both their math and reading test. Looking at the test data broken down by the 15 schools in the district revealed a few trends in what schools had more students pass the tests. The percent of students passing the math or reading test very closely followed the trends seen with the percent of students passing both tests, so only the overall percent passing rate will be discussed for brevity. \n",
    "Smaller schools, defined as fewer than 2,000 students, had an average passing rate of 90%, while medium or large schools had passing rates of 63% and 54%. Charter schools had a 90% pass rate while district schools had a much lower pass rate of 54%. These two trends could be consistent with a philosophy that additional and specialized attention results in better test scores for students. Schools that had the smallest budget per student had 90% of students pass, on average, while the schools spent the most per student had 59% pass on average. Somewhat counter-intuitively spending more per student correlated with lower percent passing rates. This could be investigated further by breaking the budget of schools to see if a particular type of spending is correlated with a lower percent of students passing."

    "    65% of the nearly 40,000 students in the district passed both their math and reading test. Looking at the test data broken down by the 15 schools in the district revealed a few trends in what schools had more students pass the tests. The percent of students passing the math or reading test very closely followed the trends seen with the percent of students passing both tests, so only the overall percent passing rate will be discussed for brevity. \n",
    "    Smaller schools, defined as fewer than 2,000 students, had an average passing rate of 90%, while medium or large schools had passing rates of 63% and 54%. Charter schools had a 90% pass rate while district schools had a much lower pass rate of 54%. These two trends could be consistent with a philosophy that additional and specialized attention results in better test scores for students. Schools that had the smallest budget per student had 90% of students pass, on average, while the schools spent the most per student had 59% pass on average. Somewhat counter-intuitively spending more per student correlated with lower percent passing rates. This could be investigated further by breaking the budget of schools to see if a particular type of spending is correlated with a lower percent of students passing.\n"
